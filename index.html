        Hey there! My name is Anya Ball and I am a freshman in the Media Arts+
        Practice Program at USC.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved here from Chicago, where I had grown up and lived my entire
        life. I moved to LA in hopes of pursuing a career in media and
        continuing my modeling work
      </p>
      <p>
        I am working towards becoming a creative director and love exploring
        different areas of media!
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
